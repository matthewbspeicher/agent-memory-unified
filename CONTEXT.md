# CONTEXT.md — Domain vocabulary

Shared language for the `agent-memory-unified` codebase. Created lazily 2026-05-22 as part of ADR-0011. Update inline when new concepts crystallize during architecture or feature work.

Companion to `docs/adr/` (decisions) and `~/.claude/skills/improve-codebase-architecture/LANGUAGE.md` (architecture vocabulary like Module, Seam, Depth).

## Trading domain

**Opportunity** — A `dataclass` emitted by an `Agent.scan()` proposing a single trade decision (buy/sell/hold + symbol + confidence + reasoning + optional suggested order). Lives in `agents/models.py`. The atomic unit downstream of every strategy. Compare *Signal*, which is broadcast on the bus and may inform many agents; an Opportunity is the agent's own externalized decision.

**Signal** — Untyped term in casual conversation; in code it means `AgentSignal` (typed payload + `signal_type` + `source_agent` + TTL) flowing through the `SignalBus`. Strategies publish Opportunities; the SignalBus carries inter-agent Signals.

**SignalBus topic** — Convention: each `signal_type` registered in `data/signal_types.py` is a "topic." Subscribers receive every published signal; queries filter by topic. Topics are typed via Pydantic models registered in `SignalTypeRegistry`. Adding a new topic is a deliberate decision (see ADR-0011 for the most recent addition, `intel_sentiment`).

**Strategy** — A class under `trading/strategies/` implementing the `Agent` ABC. The implementation half of a deployed agent. Compare *Agent*, which is the configured-and-named instance.

**Agent** — An *instance* of a strategy: a YAML entry under `trading/agents.yaml` or `trading/agents.paper.yaml` that binds a strategy to a name, schedule, universe, parameters, and trust level. The same strategy can back many agents (e.g. `kalshi_news_arb` and `polymarket_news_arb` strategies have one agent each today, but the strategy class is reusable).

**Persona** — A specialization of the `llm_analyst` (or future `react_analyst`) strategy where the YAML `system_prompt` shapes the agent's lens. Six are planned for `agents.paper.yaml`: Buffett (value), Graham (deep value), Lynch (growth), Munger (quality), Klarman (distressed), Marks (macro contrarian). Personas remain in `agents.paper.yaml` until they satisfy the ADR-0010 graduation gate.

**Trust level** — One of `monitored`, `assisted`, `autonomous`. Set per-agent in YAML. Drives router behavior in `agents/router.py`: monitored agents emit Opportunities for review; autonomous agents can route to the broker without human approval.

**Action level** — One of `notify`, `suggest_trade`, `auto_execute`. Independent of trust level; specifies what the agent is *allowed* to do with its Opportunity.

**Order terms** — The full description of an order as accepted: symbol, side, quantity, order type, limit and stop prices, time in force, and account. Two orders are the same order only if their Order terms are equal. Distinct from an order's *state* (status, filled quantity), which changes over the order's life while its terms change only by amendment.

**Paper ledger** — The record of a paper account: cash, positions, orders and their Order terms, fills, daily risk evidence, dispatch records, and applied market ticks. It is internally consistent by construction, and the account risk snapshot is derived from it alone. Compare *tracked position*, which is an Agent's view of a trade and is not part of the ledger.

**Account generation** — The identity of one life of a paper account. Resetting the account starts a new generation; orders, dispatches and reservations from an earlier generation are not valid against the new one. Use this term, not "epoch".

## Intelligence domain

**IntelReport** — Normalized output from any `intelligence/providers/*` module: `(source, symbol, score [-1..1], confidence [0..1], veto, details)`. Consumed by `enrich_confidence()` to adjust the confidence on `bittensor_consensus` signals and (per ADR-0011) published as the `intel_sentiment` topic for sentiment-source reports.

**Veto** — A boolean on `IntelReport` that, when true, signals a hard block on the enriched-consensus signal. Vetoes short-circuit normal enrichment but, post-ADR-0011, do NOT block per-provider topic publishing for non-vetoed reports.

**Sentiment** (normalized) — The aggregate score `IntelligenceLayer` produces from Fear & Greed + LunarCrush + AV AI sentiment. A single number per symbol with a confidence band. Distinct from *sentiment_spike*, which is a discrete event signal fired only on social-sentiment bursts.

## Bittensor domain

**TaoshiBridge** — The polling adapter (`integrations/bittensor/taoshi_bridge.py`) that watches the official Taoshi validator's position files and republishes them as `bittensor_miner_position` signals. See ADR-0007.

**Consensus** — The aggregated directional vote across Subnet 8 miners for a (symbol, timeframe). Published as `bittensor_consensus`; the `IntelligenceLayer` enriches it into `intel_enriched_consensus`.

## Architecture (project-specific overlays on LANGUAGE.md)

**Two-process architecture** — Per ADR-0007: the trading engine (this repo's `bittensor>=10`) and the official Taoshi validator (`taoshi-vanta/`, `bittensor==9.12.1`) run as separate venvs; the bridge is the only point of contact.

**Graduation gate** — Per ADR-0010: paper → live promotion requires backtest + paper + ops + review evidence. Personas (and any new strategy) enter via `agents.paper.yaml`.

**Scope** — Agent identity authorization unit (see `trading/api/identity/`). One of `write:orders`, `risk:halt`, `control:agents`, `admin`. New write endpoints use `require_scope(...)`, not the legacy `verify_api_key`.
